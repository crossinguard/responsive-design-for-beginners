# Responsive Design for Beginners

This project houses an [Astro](https://astro.build/)-based approach to the frontend web design files used in [Coder Coder's Responsive Design for Beginners](https://coder-coder.com/responsive/) course. 

I helped beta test this course as an entry level web developer. The full version of the course has now launched and I am attempting to recreate my solution from scratch using only the Figma design reference file.
